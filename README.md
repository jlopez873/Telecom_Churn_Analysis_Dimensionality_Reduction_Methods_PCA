# Telecom Churn Analysis Dimensionality Reduction Methods

This project focuses on reducing the dimensionality of customer data for a telecommunications company using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The reduced dataset aims to retain the most important information to better understand the key factors contributing to customer behavior and preferences, which can be used for targeted marketing campaigns and strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Installing

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `churn_clean.csv`, which contains information on the telecommunications company's customers. The dataset includes various features such as income, weekly outage duration, tenure, monthly charge, and annual bandwidth usage.

A cleaned version of the dataset is also available as `clean_dataset.csv`, which has been preprocessed for the dimensionality reduction analysis.

## Notebook Overview

The Jupyter Notebook `Dimensionality Reduction Methods.ipynb` contains the code for the dimensionality reduction analysis using PCA. It covers the following sections:

1. Research Question
2. Method Justification
3. Data Preparation
4. Analysis
5. Results

## Report

The PDF report `Dimensionality Reduction Methods.pdf` provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis, including the research question, method justification, data preparation, analysis, and results.
